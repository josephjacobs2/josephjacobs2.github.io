    <h1>Joseph's CS 1430/JavaScript Portfolio</h1>
    <p id="IntroParagraph">
        Hello! My name is Joseph Jacobs. I'm a computer science major at Weber State University. I'm making this website to showcase what I'm learning in my CS 1430: Client-Side Programming course. Directly below this you'll find a picture of myself and bellow that you'll see some demonstrations of projects made with JavaScript. I really hope that you have an excellent rest of your day!

    <h2 id="ButtonsStatus">Theme Buttons</h2>
    <p>
        <button onclick="setLightTheme()">Set Light Theme</button>
        <button onclick="setDarkTheme()">Set Dark Theme</button>
        <button onclick="setDefaultTheme()">Set Back To Default Theme</button>

    <h2><a href="ShapeAreaAndVolumeCalculator.html">Shape Area and Volume Calculator</a></h2>
    <p>
        A simple calculator to determine the area and perimeter of a circle and the volume of a sphere when inputting a certain radius.
    </p>
    <h2><a href="Tic-Tac-Toe/TicTacToe.html">Tic Tack Toe Game</a></h2>
    <p>
        Yet another simple program, this one to play mostly a mostly functional tic-tac-toe game.
    </p>
    <h2><a href="Arithmetic%20Mean%20Calculator/ArithmeticMeanCalculator.html">Arithmetic Mean Calculator</a></h2>
    <p>
        Just a simple calculator to find the mean of a few given values. It supports adding and removal of entries in the array.
    </p>
    <h2><a href="Memory%20Match/MemoryMatch.html">Memory Match Game</a></h2>
    <p>
        I'm starting to get kinda tired of calling these programs simple, but this is, yet again, a simple JavaScript game of Memory Match.
    </p>
    <h2><a href="Mastermind/mastermind_with_errors.html">Mastermind</a></h2>
    <p>
        Finally, something that isn't a simple game. This is a somewhat complex game of Mastermind that was intended to be used to learn about error handling & input validation.
    </p>
    <h2><a href="DOM%20Puzzle/Puzzle.html">DOM Puzzle</a> </h2>
    <p>
        A decently complicated puzzle involving DOM to create an image using only javascript.
